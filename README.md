<ul>
  <li>The bag is for school applications</li>
  <li>The dev icons is for development applications with Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>The Visual Studio logo is for development application with Visual Studio</li>
  <li>The soda icons is for chill applications</li>
  <li>The three dots icons is for launch app individually (not available for the moment</li>
</ul>
</p>
‚ö†Ô∏è This app has been build for me (for now, maybe a day it will be a general app who can create your shorcut), so if you want to use it you need to load the project in visual studio and change the path of your app ! ‚ö†Ô∏è
